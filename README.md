## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming room, a gaming company, wants to create Draw it or Lose it. Draw it or Lose it is a multi-platform video game where players can play against each other across devices.
## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
My recomendations for Draw it or Lose it were good given the requirements for the application.
## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found listing out my thoughts about recomendations was helpful in writing code.
## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I need to work on analyzing the esign requirements. I would improve it by going back and finding more details about what the client was wanting.
## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user needs by using react native to develop the client side application which made it multi platform. It is important to consider the user's needs because if you do not, the user will not have a good user experience.
